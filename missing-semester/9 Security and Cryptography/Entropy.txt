1. A password of five lower-case letters selected from a dictionary of size
   100,000 is log2(# of possible passwords). 

   # of possible passwords would be (100,000)^5
   assuming you can use the same word more than once. 

   So the 5 word password would have about 83 bits of entropy.


2. A password consisting of 8 alphanumeric characters, would have 62^8 possiblites.

   So it would have log2(62^8) or about 47.63 bits of entropy.


3. The 5 word password is stronger because it has more bits of entropy.


4. At a rate of 10,000 passwords / second, on average,

   the 5 word password would take 3 * 10^13 years to break

   the 8 alphanumeric passowrd would take about 690 years to break
